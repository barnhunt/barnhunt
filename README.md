This is a helper script Jeff uses for drafting Barn Hunt course maps.

It does a bunch of stuff, but the important bit is that it exports PDF
versions of maps from Inkscape SVG files.

I draw all the maps for a given ring (for a day or weekend) in a
single Inkscape drawing.  Various maps (for different trials/classes,
build map, rat-maps, base maps, etc.) are generated by hiding and
unhiding appropriate layers in the drawing and exporting to PDF.

This program automates that process.

## How to Use

Sadly, this program is currently undocumented. :-/

Kick me for more!
